 * these names have a CONSUMER outside this module: `MacroRunner.buildProgress`
 * derives per-step durations by matching `nodeStart`/`nodeFinish` together with
 * `attrs.nodeId`.
 *
 * Both sides used bare string literals, with no shared constant and no type
 * check, so renaming either one would have made the consumer's `spans.find(...)`
 * return `undefined` and silently blanked `durationMs` — with no test failing.
 * That is the same shape as the `adb:device_connected` regression: a producer and
 * a consumer that agree by coincidence instead of by construction. The only
 * difference was that it had not gone off yet.
 *
 * `scripts/audit-event-contracts.mjs` fails the build if a name declared here
 * loses its producer.
